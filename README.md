# SpringBootProject
This is a project for an exam surrounding the Spring Boot Framework.
We were not supposed to have a stylistic frontend, this project's goal was to teach the basics of the backend to frontend relationship. But i love design so i tried out some CSS just to challenge myself. 
It's a pretty simple tierlister, im glad if you tried it out! its dockerized to you can easily get it up and running on your own computer.
